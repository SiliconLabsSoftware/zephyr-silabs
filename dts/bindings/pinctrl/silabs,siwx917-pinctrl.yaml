  The Silabs SiWx917 pin controller is a devicetree node tasked with selecting
  the proper IO function for a given pin.

  Create this node in the SoC devicetree as follows:

    pinctrl0: pinctrl {
      compatible = "silabs,siwx917-pinctrl";
    };

  This node expects a vector of three values:
    - Base number: 0 is high power, 1 is low power
    - Port number
    - Pin number
    - Mux (IO function)
    - Pad selection

  Create a configuration by referencing the 'pinctrl' node:

    &pinctrl0 {
      group1: group1 {
        pinmux = <0 0 29 2 0>;
      };
    };

compatible: "silabs,siwx917-pinctrl"
