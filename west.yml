# West manifest file for Silicon Labs SDK for Zephyr.

# The west workspace configuration file, .west/config, sets the

# "path" variable.
#
# You are free to create your own manifest files and put them in any
# repository you want, to create your own custom workspaces.
# For example, you could create a manifest file in your own application
# directory, which would pull this repository in as an ordinary project.
